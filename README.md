# FlaskBlog
Simple blog site with basic functionality using Python's Flask framework<br/>
The app is made using DEV Containers. So you need VS Code with DEV Containers extension and Docker Desktop installed on your machine to test this app.<br/>
The create_db_n_fill_dummy_data.py as the name suggests creates the table structure and create two users and fill DB with some dummy data.<br/>
Go throught the script to know the dummy user's ID and password.<br/>
I have kept the .env file in there for convenience but the password is incorrect.
